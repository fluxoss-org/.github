# Flux: The Elevator Pitch

**Flux: Think Git worktrees + event sourcing + AI intent detection with all the best of distributed version control without the merge conflicts and manual coordination.**

Flux is the AI-powered version control system that understands what your code changes actually accomplish.

## The 30-Second Version

Modern development moves at AI speed with distributed teams building complex systems. Flux introduces semantic version control that understands the meaning behind code changes, automatically resolves conflicts, and helps teams collaborate effortlessly.

## The Opportunity

Software development is evolving rapidly - AI assists with code generation, teams span continents, and systems grow in complexity daily. Our tooling needs to evolve too.

## The Innovation

**Atomic Change Units (ACUs)** - Flux organizes changes around meaningful units like "add user authentication" or "optimize database queries." AI understands the intent, impact, and relationships between changes across your entire codebase.

## Key Capabilities

- **Intelligent conflict resolution** - AI automatically handles 90%+ of integration conflicts
- **Semantic understanding** - Knows what changes accomplish, not just what text changed
- **Team orchestration** - Proactive coordination that prevents problems before they occur
- **Seamless integration** - Works alongside existing Git workflows with full history preservation

## The Vision

Version control that acts as an intelligent development partner - understanding your goals, anticipating problems, and amplifying team productivity.
